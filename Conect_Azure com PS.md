Connect to Azure using PowerShell

In this exercise, you will use PowerShell to connect to your Azure subscription and retrieve information about your subscription.

Open a PowerShell prompt.

Run the Login-AzureRmAccount command.

If you are prompted to enable data collection, type N.

If you receive an error message that you can’t be signed in because cookies are blocked, perform Step 5. Otherwise, continue with Step 6.

Run Internet Explorer. If this is the first time running it, enable the default settings. Otherwise, configure Internet Explorer to accept cookies by going to the settings, going to the Privacy tab, and configuring the Advanced settings.

In the sign-in window, type the email address or phone number of your Azure account. If you are prompted to specify a work/school account or a personal account, choose the one that corresponds to your Azure subscription. Then, type your password and click the Sign in button. If you have multi-factor authentication, complete the authentication process.

If the sign in succeeds and the account is an administrator for an Azure subscription, then your Azure account information will be listed. Now, you can explore.

Run the Get-AzureRmSubscription command to view the subscriptions associated with the account.
